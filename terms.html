        </ul>
        <p>Quit Anonymous does not provide therapy, medical treatment, or clinical addiction services. The App is not a substitute for licensed mental health professionals. If you are in crisis, please contact local emergency services or a qualified professional.</p>

        <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To use the App, you may sign in using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email</li>
          <li>Phone number</li>
          <li>Google Sign-In</li>
          <li>Apple Sign-In</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You agree to provide accurate information and keep your account secure.</p>

        <h2>4. Subscription &amp; Billing</h2>
        <p>Quit Anonymous offers auto-renewing subscriptions managed through the Apple App Store.</p>
        <h3>Subscription Options</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>$9.99 per month (7-day free trial)</li>
          <li>$44.99 per year (7-day free trial)</li>
          <li>$3.99 per week (3-day trial; one-time onboarding offer)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Auto-Renewal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</li>
          <li>Your Apple ID will be charged at confirmation of purchase and at each renewal period.</li>
          <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Trial Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you begin a free trial and purchase a subscription, unused trial periods are forfeited.</li>
          <li>Trial periods are offered only once per Apple ID unless otherwise specified by Apple.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>All purchases are final and non-refundable except where required by law. Refund requests must be submitted through Apple (not us).</p>

        <h2>6. Small Anonymous Groups</h2>
        <p>The App connects you with a small anonymous group of four people for accountability. By using this feature, you understand that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No real names are shared within the group to support AA-style anonymity.</li>
          <li>Group members only see the limited information you choose to share (such as check-ins or support requests).</li>
          <li>You agree to treat group members respectfully and keep group discussions private.</li>
          <li>We may adjust group membership or remove members to protect safety and integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. AI Chat (Ano)</h2>
        <p>The App includes an AI-powered support owl (“Ano”) for motivational and reflective conversation.</p>
        <h3>AI Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ano is not a therapist.</li>
          <li>AI responses are generated using third-party models (e.g., OpenAI API).</li>
          <li>Avoid sharing extremely sensitive personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>AI Data Processing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Messages you send to Ano may be processed and stored to provide continuity.</li>
          <li>Onboarding responses, relapse entries, and panic mode inputs may be paired with your chats and sent to OpenAI GPT models to personalize answers.</li>
          <li>AI conversations should not be treated as professional advice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Family Controls and App Blocking</h2>
        <p>The App can request device permissions (such as Apple Screen Time or family controls) to block selected apps during strong urges and reduce access to adult content.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You choose which apps are blocked and when.</li>
          <li>Blocking depends on device settings and may not work on every app or device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Panic Mode and Grounding Tasks</h2>
        <p>When Panic Mode is enabled, blocked apps can be unlocked only after you complete grounding tasks or wait 20 minutes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grounding tasks include journaling plus breathing, walking, and meditation.</li>
          <li>You may also wait 20 minutes to unlock access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Notifications</h2>
        <p>The App may send notifications, which you can toggle off at any time in Settings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Daily reminder</li>
          <li>Urge support</li>
          <li>Group activity</li>
          <li>Milestone notification</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Data Controls &amp; Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can download or delete your data from the App settings.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you delete your account, deletion is immediate with no recovery or delay.</li>
          <li>You can clear local cache data in the App settings to remove on-device copies.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Use the App to harass or harm others</li>
          <li>Misuse the anonymous group or panic mode features</li>
